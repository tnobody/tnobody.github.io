Hi together my name is Tim Keiner (=nobody in english ;)) and I'm a passionate developer and this is the first time that I'm really created my own blog publishing system.

## Goals

> I know that I know nothing

The longer I code, the more I understand this [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing). Since I got a lot of knowledge from a varienty of blogs I want to give something back and maybe you'll find some useful pieces for your work on this page.

Since I'm also interested in all kinds of _new_ web technologies, I'll use this page as personal playground to investigate in new technologies.
